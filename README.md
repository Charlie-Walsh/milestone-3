# User Experience

## User Stories

### Firts Time Visitors

- First time visitors will be able to see exactly what the site is about when they hit the landing page and will be able to easily navigate their way around the site to find what they need.
- I would like the site to have a clean design to help with easy navigation and to be easy to read.

### Returning Visitors

- Returning visitors should be able to quickly find their way to leaving a review of their own or look for something new. Or the next book the series theyve started etc.
- They should be able to edit their previous reviews if they have changed their minds on a second read through, add anything they have forgotten or delete the review entirely.

## Bugs

 - Pylint bug encountered using flask-sqlAlchemy giving "Instance of 'SQLAlchemy' has no 'Column' member" error. This is a known issue and requires you to crash the plug in to remove it. I didn't want to risk messing with this too much so I am just ignoring it so far. I could put a #noqa comment on every one but that seems a bit redundant for now.
